## Project Overview

This ETL project focuses on the following key objectives:

1. **Region Segmentation**: Classifying customers based on geographical data to better understand market dynamics.
2. **Sales Performance Analysis**: Evaluating product performance across different regions to inform business strategies.
3. **Data Integration**: Merging various data sources to create a comprehensive view of sales and customer behavior.

The pipeline is designed to be scalable and efficient, making it suitable for businesses of all sizes. 

## Technologies Used

- **SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)**: For data extraction, transformation, and loading.
- **Microsoft SQL Server**: As the primary database for storing and querying data.
- **Data Visualization Tools**: Tools like Power BI or Tableau can be used for visualizing the insights generated from the data.
- **Python**: Optional for additional data manipulation and analysis.

## Features

- **Automated Data Extraction**: Automatically pulls data from multiple sources.
- **Transformations**: Cleans and prepares data for analysis.
- **Data Loading**: Efficiently loads data into the SQL Server database.
- **Real-Time Analytics**: Provides insights in real-time for better decision-making.
- **Scalability**: Easily adapts to growing data needs.

## Installation

To set up the ETL pipeline on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alwi2404/ETL-Pipeline-for-Region-Segmentation-and-Product-Performance-Analysis.git
   ```
   
2. **Install SQL Server**: Ensure you have SQL Server installed on your machine.

3. **Set Up SSIS**: Open SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) and import the SSIS project from the cloned repository.

4. **Configure Connections**: Update the connection strings in the SSIS package to point to your data sources.

5. **Execute the Package**: Run the SSIS package to start the ETL process.

## Usage

Once the pipeline is set up, you can execute it to extract and analyze data. The results will be stored in the SQL Server database, where you can run queries to generate insights.

### Example Queries

Here are a few example SQL queries you can run:

1. **Total Sales by Region**:
   ```sql
   SELECT Region, SUM(Sales) AS TotalSales
   FROM SalesData
   GROUP BY Region;
   ```

2. **Top Performing Products**:
   ```sql
   SELECT ProductName, SUM(Sales) AS TotalSales
   FROM SalesData
   GROUP BY ProductName
   ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;
   ```

## Data Pipeline Structure

The data pipeline consists of the following stages:

1. **Data Sources**: Various sources such as CSV files, databases, or APIs.
2. **Data Extraction**: Using SSIS to pull data from the sources.
3. **Data Transformation**: Cleaning and formatting the data to ensure quality.
4. **Data Loading**: Inserting the transformed data into SQL Server.
5. **Analysis and Reporting**: Generating reports and visualizations based on the loaded data.
